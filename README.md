# Bot-Discord-JS-Activity-Auto-Changer
<a> Some code I wrote to help programers change their Discord Bot Status automatically within a certain amount of seconds </a>
<p> If you want to change it feel free, there is no copyright so feel free to use it in anyway</p>
<p> If you need help with anything my Discord is Leon#8909</p>
<p> Copy and paste below where you import all your modules</p>
